Question - what is Churn?
Answer - Churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given 
         period. It's a critical metric for businesses, especially those with subscription-based models, as it directly impacts revenue and 
         growth.
         Example:
                 For a subscription-based streaming service, if 100 customers were subscribed at the beginning of the month and 10 of them 
                 canceled their subscriptions by the end of the month, the churn rate would be 10%.

                 Churn Rate Calculation:
                 Churn Rate =(Number of Customers Lost / Total Number of Customers at the Start) × 100
